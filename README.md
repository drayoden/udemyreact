  - environment:
    - update node
    - vscode extensions: live server, es7 react..., material icons

18 - using useState
  - see App.js:
    - useState -- built-in react 'hook' -- see comments
    - Note: in dev tools, name only updates on SECOND click because this is due to how react  schedules updates; console.log runs before the update.
