  - environment:
    - update node
    - vscode extensions: live server, es7 react..., material icons

24 - multiple components:
  - have only seen/used one compoenet so far; App
  - normally, subsequent components would be nested inside App to create a tree of components

                      App (root component)
                      / \                  
                Navbar  Eventlist
                /    \        
              Logo   Menu
  
  - each new component would have its own file, component function and template.
