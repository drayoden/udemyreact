  - environment:
    - update node
    - vscode extensions: live server, es7 react..., material icons

26 - props (property)
  - pass data from parent to child
    - pass title prop from App to Title: why do this? to create a "reusable" Title component.
    - note how the Title component in App.js is changed to pass the props to the Title component
    - see how the Title component is reused also.
