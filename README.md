  - environment:
    - update node
    - vscode extensions: live server, es7 react..., material icons

12 - make react site (SPA - Single Page App)
  - server sends single page to browser, all browser interaction is 'built-in'; no server requests are needed.
  - create react app - sets up your environment to develop an SPA
    * NOTE: `npx` temporarily downloads a package and runs it. `npm` permanetly installs a package but does not run it.
    * `npx create-react-app .` creates all folders/files in the current folder
      - this creates a project with the name of the parent directory (package.json): 'udemyreact'
    * `npx create-react-app <proj name>` creates all folder/files in folder <proj name>
